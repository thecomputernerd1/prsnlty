I feel incomplete, I dont feel emotionally connected and I always change every time and then. Im tired being surrounded by these people who dominates me and handling my life....Why are we so kind individual? I mean why do we always want to help? I think its because we want to be notice. I want to feel that I belong in this world too. Is that so wrong? Grrr.I would like to be alone than dealing with people who judge me easily. I enjoy being alone, like this surfing the net, being independent and not relying and bothering other people.Hm. In my case I always feel like im inside the shell :((Maybe they were just hurt for judging the child personalityI always daydreaming about me. I am a singer in a concert and the crowds are clapping and enjoying their time listening to my voice. They look like they are really having fun :))) ROFLI always feel that I never did anything good.

And I choose choices between what is right or wrong. Of course I follow the right things.Hehehe. I feel the same way. I dont talk to people I know well. I find them boring or even senseless to talk to. I want to be alone and do what keeps me happy. People will just leave, I think they...Hm. Yeah. I think I change a lot. I dont know Its just Im being so nice and giving to people whom I really care, yet they dont know how to appreciate me.I think you should leave the house. Hehehe. You dont need your family if they dont understand you or even listen to you. There are thousands of people and you are not alone. Just get a life you know....You INFPs are always self pitying.Yehey! You agree with me! Yes its nudity but not trying to seduce them.Yeah I think they should not look.What? You think its hot? My parents are telling me to put on clothes. But I really dislike it! Do you think its okay to walk around the house nude?Hi everyone! Do you wear clothes? Me, I dont like wearing clothes I feel uncomfortable with clothes that I wear even if they look good on me. I just hate wearing clothes. And I dont wear clothes when...Woah ESTPs vulnerable? Really? You guys have a good body which I really admire. Maybe you are strong outside but vulnerable insideAre you 594? hehehe. Im 459. Glad to meet you :))Have you ever experience that people laugh at us so/sx's? uh. I hate it!

They prefer to spend more time on their own or with a couple of people they know well. Introversion grants individuals with a set of features, which makes them completely different from the type of personality presented by extroverts. According to Cain, introverts prefer to limit their circles to a few acquaintances; however, they build extremely stable and long-lasting relationships (Cain); they tend to know people better than extroverts. Introverts become exhausted rather quickly by constant contact with other people. Introverts often prefer to work alone as opposed to with a team. They do not take action as quickly as extroverts, and tend to ponder over a problem at hand before starting to solve it. However, due of this, they often foresee consequences that escape their extrovert counterparts, thus taking more effective actions and making more efficient decisions. Due to the peculiarities of their thinking process, introverts are often misunderstood by those around them; they are often believed to be detached and unemotional, though they might be simply thinking about their interlocutor’s words. They could be experiencing a real emotional storm inside, but show little of it on the outside.\"])\n",

I should judge them because they deserve to be. When Alice broke her engagment ring that was because she couldnot cope with the conditions.The alarming rise in the aggressive and indiscipline behaviour of modern youths like burning cars, buses, destroying public property, assaulting common men on slightest faults, eve teasing, and passing filthy comments on women raise finger at the way the society is progressing. We say we are educated, civilized and belong to great nations of the world. We say, we have high traditions, glorious culture and heritage. We feel proud for the contribution and sacrifice of our grand-parents, great grand-parents and forefathers to the nation at the cost of their personal interests and comfort and happiness. But at the same time we feel ashamed at the dangerous rise in the aggressive and violent behaviour of the present generation throughout the world though the degree of violence and aggression varies from place to place, society to society and country to country. Mahatma Gandhi and his associates who could get back the independence of India through non-violence are perhaps forgotten in this world full of violence and aggression. The remarkable increase of violence and aggression in the behaviour of the educated and uneducated, rich and poor, employers and unemployed reminds one of a world full of dangerous, chronic and infectious diseases. Aggression and violence are diseases of human mind and difficult though not impossible to cure. Most people forget the term “Non violence” under these conditions of the present society. Moreover, the cold war between big and small nations, the violent conflict between various nations on various geographical, social, economic, political and cultural issues, are on the increase in-spite of the functioning of various world peace groups. Boarder issue between various neighbouring countries has increased the aggressive and violent behaviour of people. Terrorists and Militant groups are daily engaged in mass murder of innocent citizens. Further, with the increase in atomic expulsion and atomic power groups the matter has further deteriorated and no one knows what will happen to human life next moment.\"])\n",

It was supposed to be a small tea-party with a few friends and family members. As he is the eldest in the family, he asked me to come and help him with the preparations. A day before, we went to the market and brought the necessary decoration articles. We decided for a few minutes on the food and other things with my friend’s father. We also ordered for the cake from the bakery his father asked us to. We both were really excited, as my friend was turning 16 this year. I decided to go straight at his place after school to help him with the decorations. I had already kept my clothes there, so dressing up was no problem. Both Uncle and Aunty are working, so they too were very glad and relieved with me there to help their son prepare for his birthday party. One our way back home from school, we collected the cake and the eatables that we had ordered the day before. Then we hurried back home. We quickly had our lunch and headed for the drawing-room.

What I know is that there’s nothing else that I enjoy as much as dancing.   It’s something I can do with my friends and it’s a way to meet new people.   Aside from enjoying a lot of music and dance itself, I love how every dance has a history and is an integral part of Hispanic cultures.  I want to learn more dance because I think it will help me better understand the cultures and histories of various countries. In many countries, there are national dances but I think that other non -native dances of the country are gaining more popularity?   Merengue, cambia, salsa, Durango, northern, tango – all are dances from different places in the Latin world, and many more.   Each has its special music, specific steps, and unique outfit.

They prefer to spend more time on their own or with a couple of people they know well. Introversion grants individuals with a set of features, which makes them completely different from the type of personality presented by extroverts. According to Cain, introverts prefer to limit their circles to a few acquaintances; however, they build extremely stable and long-lasting relationships (Cain); they tend to know people better than extroverts. Introverts become exhausted rather quickly by constant contact with other people. Introverts often prefer to work alone as opposed to with a team. They do not take action as quickly as extroverts, and tend to ponder over a problem at hand before starting to solve it. However, due of this, they often foresee consequences that escape their extrovert counterparts, thus taking more effective actions and making more efficient decisions. Due to the peculiarities of their thinking process, introverts are often misunderstood by those around them; they are often believed to be detached and unemotional, though they might be simply thinking about their interlocutor’s words. They could be experiencing a real emotional storm inside, but show little of it on the outside.\"])\n",

I should judge them because they deserve to be. When Alice broke her engagment ring that was because she couldnot cope with the conditions.The alarming rise in the aggressive and indiscipline behaviour of modern youths like burning cars, buses, destroying public property, assaulting common men on slightest faults, eve teasing, and passing filthy comments on women raise finger at the way the society is progressing. We say we are educated, civilized and belong to great nations of the world. We say, we have high traditions, glorious culture and heritage. We feel proud for the contribution and sacrifice of our grand-parents, great grand-parents and forefathers to the nation at the cost of their personal interests and comfort and happiness. But at the same time we feel ashamed at the dangerous rise in the aggressive and violent behaviour of the present generation throughout the world though the degree of violence and aggression varies from place to place, society to society and country to country. Mahatma Gandhi and his associates who could get back the independence of India through non-violence are perhaps forgotten in this world full of violence and aggression. The remarkable increase of violence and aggression in the behaviour of the educated and uneducated, rich and poor, employers and unemployed reminds one of a world full of dangerous, chronic and infectious diseases. Aggression and violence are diseases of human mind and difficult though not impossible to cure. Most people forget the term “Non violence” under these conditions of the present society. Moreover, the cold war between big and small nations, the violent conflict between various nations on various geographical, social, economic, political and cultural issues, are on the increase in-spite of the functioning of various world peace groups. Boarder issue between various neighbouring countries has increased the aggressive and violent behaviour of people. Terrorists and Militant groups are daily engaged in mass murder of innocent citizens. Further, with the increase in atomic expulsion and atomic power groups the matter has further deteriorated and no one knows what will happen to human life next moment.\"])\n",

A day before, we went to the market and brought the necessary decoration articles. We decided for a few minutes on the food and other things with my friend’s father. We also ordered for the cake from the bakery his father asked us to. We both were really excited, as my friend was turning 16 this year. I decided to go straight at his place after school to help him with the decorations. I had already kept my clothes there, so dressing up was no problem. Both Uncle and Aunty are working, so they too were very glad and relieved with me there to help their son prepare for his birthday party. One our way back home from school, we collected the cake and the eatables that we had ordered the day before. Then we hurried back home. We quickly had our lunch and headed for the drawing-room.

Merengue, cambia, salsa, Durango, northern, tango – all are dances from different places in the Latin world, and many more.   Each has its special music, specific steps, and unique outfit.

Iï¿½m pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. Iï¿½m doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. Iï¿½m not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much Iï¿½ll have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the ROTC unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study.

I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. Iï¿½m not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much Iï¿½ll have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the ROTC unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study.

            "['Well right now just woke up from mid day nap It sort of weird but ever since moved to Texas have had problems concentrating on things remember starting my homework in th grade as soon as the clock struck and not stopping until it was done Of course it was easier but still did it But when moved here the homework got little more challenging and there was lot more busy work and so decided not to spend hours doing it and just getting by But the thing was that always paid attention in class and just plain out knew the stuff and now that look back if had really worked hard and stayed on track the last two years without getting lazy would have been genius but hey that all good It too late to correct the past but don really know how to stay focused the future The one thing know is that when people say that c they live on campus they can concentrate it b For me it would be easier there but alas m living at home under the watchful eye of my parents and little nagging sister that just nags and nags and nags You get my point Another thing is is that it just hassle to have to go all the way back to school to just to go to library to study need to move out but don know how to tell them Don get me wrong see where they re coming from and why they don want me to move out but need to get away and be on my own They ve sheltered me so much and don have worry in the world The only thing that they ask me to do is keep my room clean and help out with the business once in while but can even do that But need to But got enough money from UT to live at dorm or apartment next semester and think ll take advantage of that But off that topic now went to sixth street last night and had blast haven been there in so long Now know why love Austin so much When lived in VA used to go up to DC all the time and had blast but here there are so many students running around at night just want to have some fun and know that am responsible enough to be able to have fun but keep my priorities straight Living at home can go out at all without them asking where with who why when are you coming back and all those questions just wish could be treated like responsible person for once but my sister screwed that up for me She went crazy the second she moved into college and messed up her whole college career by partying too much And that the ultimate reason that they don want me to go and have fun But m not little anymore and they need to let me go and explore the world but m Indian with Indian culture with Indian values They go against having fun mean in the sense of meeting people or going out with people or partying or just plain having fun My school is difficult already but somehow think that having more freedom will put more pressure on me to do better in school c that what my parents and ultimately expect of myself Well it been fun writing don know if you go anything out of this writing but it helped me get some of my thoughts into order So hope you had fun reading it and good luck TA ', 'Well here we go with the stream of consciousness essay used to do things like this in high school sometimes They were pretty interesting but often find

that a bad thing mind you but my English teacher freshman year made us do these assignments constantly and mine were always completely ridiculous like wow m really hungry wish could go to Taco Bell They really had no point except as busy work In psychology class though can see the reasoning behind an assignment like this Just letting my mind go free and putting my random thoughts down in writing could be big help in figuring out why m such psychological screw up Well that not true don want all getting the wrong idea about me being that today was the first day of class and all m really not nut case People may think am but really m normal kind of gal Actually down here in Texas guess m not normal don like to eat biscuits and gravy for breakfast and country fried steak with fried okra for dinner m from Connecticut and we don even HAVE okra much less worship it like it some kind of vegetable goddess My mind is starting to go blank performance pressure guess m on the spot here don want you all to be bored while you re reading this if you ever do get around to reading this that is Well m not going to stress just yet so you re probably going to have to listen to some of my random incoherent babbling for few paragraphs These computers are big old pain in the ass Here in the SMF sure they ve got bajillion computers but unfortunately we ve got bajillion students trying to use them all at the same time think ll be spending quite few late late nights in the computer center just to get my stuff done Yippee That what college is all about late nights in the libraries Yeah Right At this point don even know what college is all about probably shouldn say anything though seeing as how m going to have to write another one of these thingys in few days where the topic is college Blah blah blah can believe m actually doing this assignment on the same day that is was assigned Go me Talk about dedication really can believe this In high school procrastination was my middle name No it was my first name By second semester have more free periods in day than actual classes so didn have to do damn thing It was great Unfortunately because of that m going to have to work that much harder here at UT to get those studying skills back up to par High School Now that was trip When was there couldn wait to get out of there hated that school that town everything except my friends of course Then my family moved right after graduation and learned real quick that there were worse places to be than in my old town At least back home have my friends and my boyfriend and my piece of crap car and knew what there was to do After moved had no friends no life no car no nothing worked all day That it now though m ready for this whole college thing Austin seems like fun city where might actually enjoy spending the next four years Oh yeah While we re on the subject of four years why is it that all the professors administrators that give speeches and stuff always make it sound like we ll be in college for like or years m sorry but plan on graduating in years What the problem here What are people doing that they can graduate in years just don get it no offense if any of all reading this took like years to do your undergrad work m not trying to knock you just trying to figure this out Well it exactly minutes after started this nifty little piece of writing that makes no sense and has no point m not really sure if have fulfilled this assignment like if was supposed to analyze my personal stream of consciousness where it took me and what that means regarding my own personality guess if had to could say that my mind works in mysterious ways and even if the above essay seems to be illogically connected to me can see the patterns Yeah just went back tried to read this over again and ve got to give suggestion For these assignments make the box we re writing in box where you can see the whole line of writing at one time without have to scroll across because it a real big pain for me and m sure it just as big pain for you when you re trying to read it Unless of course when you read it you can see the whole line at once don know just suggestion Thanks for taking the time to give us all the opportunity to get an easy of out final grade through these writing assignments ', 'Today Had to turn the music down Today went to the KVRX meeting will hopefully

supposed to have some kind of direction or am supposed to write exactly what am thinking This feels like very strange assignment for homework it seems that it pretty easy Actually it would be pretty intense if this was worth more than however much it is worth Hmm for some reason am blanked out and it seems like am thinking about nothing Oh well Lets see what happened today lucked out on my econ quiz was actually able to guess my way to What are the chances of that having faith definitely pays off always say that it is important to have faith That my motto in life Have faith and have fun Life

That is lot peoples garbage talk you have to read Maybe it isn I have no idea what it is This screen is really weird How come only three lines have popped up have been writing for minutes Is this some kind of ploy so we can not see what we have written can not believe that only thought about that now In fact just noticed that only this much was on the screen Very Very Interesting am getting tired of typing am waiting for these final minutes to tick away hope you gain something out of this because don think will actually might but have no idea how was thinking about quitting early but what if you had some kind of device that told you how long was on for That is actually pretty scary only god knows what technology can do nowadays Anyway hope you enjoy reading this It is quite possible that

upon miles after earning the right to be here and then squander it on stupid sound effects and loud music If wanted to hear Inspector Gadget during the Simpson I would change the channel only get to watch v for minutes or so day and certainly want to choose and if my roommate and don choose why should that inconsiderate shmuck down the hall get to Speaking of halls that turn was so tight in the one off of my computer room used to feel plush carpet under my feet and the cold refreshing taste of Coke when walked quickly into the room to begin my work for the night And all those shows that missed missed countless mindless hours of television Pure mind numbing entertainment what can beat that see industrial carpet on the wall right now How plush my bed was Jake used to love when gave him nip or scratched his ears at night It reminds me of when that bumpkin exterminator came to the large clean inviting house thought he was bob cat So the vet called him big boned that doesn mean he was obese So he ate bowls day and was pound cat with gut That reminds me of Cats when the twenty pounder is the human equivalent of or so pounds That theatre rocked M Pei is awesome but that other guy on v is an eccentric freak The Myerson is cool could go for some more hot chocolate now just like during the Christmas musical we went to That guy was pretty short who my mom worked with and bald as

Paul was already being an asshole and they took the dogs out Allison had begun Paul had Jodi and trey had flip and they left the walker bitch spice in the truck so we start walking toward the creek which turned out to be raw sewage and refused to go any further and Paul screamed at me that was bitch and he didn give fuck what did so went back through the woods with no flashlight so could get in the truck have never been more scarred in my entire life prayed the whole time and took spice out because was afraid that was going to get raped and murdered or something was bawling and trying to tell my parents through telepathy that loved them and that would miss them because was going to die then heard voice yelling my name and asking for help it was trey he was coming back to make sure was okay was so happy then about minutes later the others came back they looked like night of the living dead with briars and thorns all in their hair they told me they wished they stayed with me then they got in their bras and panties because their clothes were soaked with sewage and we drove home the whole time Paul is bitching to Allison about everything and treating her like shit think she

I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. Iï¿½m not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much Iï¿½ll have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the ROTC unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study.

            "Today bought the new Omoide Hatoba CD Pure noise and noise art are very interesting forms of music Sometimes there are lyrics to these songs Most of the time they are just phrases being repeated or just screams Some bands have gone so far as to create their own languages This type of music bypasses your brain and hits you straight in the gut Words are very limiting way of expressing how this music makes you feel need to remember to go to the video store tomorrow and rent purple rain Prince is very talented as musician and actor would love top see him in concert really hope that the October pavement concert will be confirmed soon cant believe that my English teacher is good friends with the lead singer This is strange assignment it makes me wonder what other people will write and who will read this Will anyone read this What if someone writes something truly offensive It not their fault One cannot be responsible for their words when they free write Can you imagine if there was an assignment where the teacher tells the students Ignore all social constraints and act freely for the next minutes That would be pretty wild In my everyday speech often swear By not swearing in this am limiting myself But how far can one free write How much can you open yourself up until its just words thrown together Grammar is not important to this yet assume you expect some common grammar to hold this together Am not free writing now would like to go on tour with professional wrestling league and write about their tragic lives Professional wrestlers mutate their bodies with steroids to the point where they no longer seem human They destroy their bodies and on occasion fight in steel cages wonder if they ever look in the mirror and ask themselves what have done m not even human anymore Their job is to fake fight The world of celebrities is quite interesting wonder if their is an equation that could make someone famous could use the scientific method My hypothesis could be If one writes song on the piano Elton John style about celebrity after they die it will be success could have started this when Versace died and continued it when Diana died Of course this would not sum it all up but after numerous studies feel could ultimately find mathematical secret to success in the entertainment field \n",

            "You know when typing on computer twenty minutes is long time Figuring person types to words per minutes they will be typing between words and words per minute wonder if this assignment would be more effective if the students had to write it in pen so that you could also see how they changed their mind know that have already erased and retyped don mean that have taken the stream of consciousness out of it just that will change my mind on how want to phrase things want this to make sense to any poor unfortunate person who has to read this thing and sometimes takes me while figure out way to phrase thing that will accurately get the message of what am trying to express across Okay have managed to confuse myself with this stuff that am saying Somehow don consider it to be good sign when can confuse myself with something that am thinking It too bad that type faster than think c right now can even get all of my thoughts down Wow it finally put me on another line don have any idea what time actually started typing remember looking at the clock at but was already typing then guess that will just count that as my starting time am guessing that it really doesn matter how long write Back to the confusing myself thing you know have habit of confusing myself will ask myself questions or think about ideas which really are lacking in logic or else they have strange logic For example at my high school am famous for my opinions about being normal once told my friend that was the only normal person and that the rest of them were all abnormal Having said this realize that if am the only normal person that would make it abnormal to be normal and normal to be abnormal This would mean that although was the only normal person in the group was really abnormal c it is normal to be abnormal and abnormal to be normal At first this appears to make no sense but once you think about it for while it starts to make perfect sense at least to me anyway And those people who have been blessed enough to hear this theory get it eventually have no idea if am supposed to be writing this thing as if was talking to someone but that is really the only way that can write it am used to writing emails lot like this and have tendency to talk like this too will say or write whatever is on my mind This results in lack of sentences in my emails separate the thoughts with little dots everything is in sentence fragments just write what am thinking at the time That is why was so happy about this assignment imagine am getting grade for doing something that do all the time But then again it not like the people write to hate my emails In fact most of them love my emails My boyfriend Justin always tells me how much he loves my emails And lately have noticed that have been influencing people with the way write More and more of my friends have started writing very stream of consciousness emails to me like them though c think that they give greater insight into how person if feeling and what they are thinking am terrible speller and bad typer too can type really fast but am not high on the accuracy Sometimes do really great but other times well it embarrassing think that in college am gonna major in typos and creative spelling haven eaten anything today It is now guess after finish this will go back to the dorm room and then will go eat dinner Or maybe won I am not really that hungry but feel bad about wasting meal tickets Last week didn eat anywhere near the two meals day that we bought might just go and eat some yogurt that have in the fridge The advantage to not eating and then getting all this extra exercise walking around this school is that it will help me get in shape This is ridiculous it has been minutes and am only on the now fifth line You know don like typing think that am candidate for carpal tunnel am exaggerating bit but my hands get tired quickly from typing think that strain them c the table is too high and therefore am resting my hands on the keyboard too much just moved the keyboard to my lap and that actually helps am semi computer nerd know about software and how to use the web However am not hacker and my knowledge of hardware is not the best maybe average can build my own computer or do anything illegal but put program in front of me and will either know how to use it or else will figure out how to use it fairly quickly am glad that this about finished It is actually tiring trying to keep up with what am thinking just finished psych class and so decided to stop at the pcl library and do this before forget meant to do these assignments this weekend but forgot actually just didn get time My best friends online boyfriend came to Houston this weekend and am friends with him too so wanted to meet him also He flew in from Anderson CA quite far We had never met him before now He is really nice too only he is bit inappropriate acting in that he was feeling me and he even French kissed me he felt on Amber my friend too and kissed her more but the point is his hands should only be up one person shirt and that is Amber not me hope that this won really get published c this stuff about Giovanni is not something that want everyone to find out about He was still really nice and liked him just not romantically guess maybe he is just like that did tell Amber about what happened needed to if she didn mind which for some reason she didn then it all good well cept that don want him to kiss me or feel up my shirt or in my overalls That is why won let him do it again however don know when or if will see him again so it may never come up Anyway time is up so am gonna submit this thing and hike it back to the dorm actually the dorm isn too far might sit outside and read the paper before going back though It will depend on how feel Okay here it is hope it was helpful or served the purpose it was supposed to \n",
